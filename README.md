# Prompt
As a software engineer, you’ll be working on the technical development of the platform on a week to week basis, building software that makes an impact. Imagine you’re working with the World Health Organization to develop a new web platform for them to track what vaccines are getting distributed where. Specifically, you’re tasked with setting up the basic infrastructure of the website to include the following features:
- Unauthenticated homepage
- Sign in form with email and password
- Register form which includes people’s basic info (name, email, password, etc.)
- Authenticated homepage that is different from the unauthenticated version
- One additional feature of your choice (ex: profile picture, admin view, etc.)
